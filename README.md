# Folder Object

Provides a simple component which turns a GameObject into a "folder" for organising your scene.

Forces the transform to:
Pos 0, 0, 0
Rot 0, 0, 0
Scale 1, 1, 1

To avoid local offsets impacting child objects, and hides the transform component in the inspector.

To disable this behaviour, and reshow the transform, just remove the FolderObject component.
